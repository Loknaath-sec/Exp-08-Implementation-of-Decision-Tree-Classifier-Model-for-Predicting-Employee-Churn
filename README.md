# Exp-08: Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Classifier Model for Predicting Employee Churn.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import the required libraries .
2. Read the data frame using pandas.
3. Get the information regarding the null values present in the dataframe.
4. Apply label encoder to the non-numerical column inoreder to convert into numerical values.
5. Determine training and test data set.
6. Apply decision tree Classifier on to the dataframe.
7. Get the values of accuracy and data prediction.
